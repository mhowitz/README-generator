  ## Description

  This Project was created using Node.js and the Inquirer package for a user to create a high quality README file for their projects. Once the app is run in Node, the user is prompted with multiple questions that will generate a README file for the user. It contains a Table of Contents, a license badge, a license, installation and usage instructions, and a section where the user can add their email and GitHub profile.

  ## Table of Contents

  * [Installation](#installation)
  * [Usage](#usage)
  * [License](#license)
  * [Contributing](#contributing)
  * [Questions](#questions)
  
  
  ## Installation

  To use this application, the user must have Node.js and the Inquirer package installed. Once the user has these installed, they can open the terminal and type "node index" and the user will be prompted with multiple quesitons before the README file is generated.
  
  ## Usage

  When the user runs the file, they are asked questions about their name, the name of their project, a description of their project, installation and usage instructions, and then which license they would like to add to their project. Once they answer these questions, then they may add contributors, their GitHub username, and their email for contacting them. There are three prompts that are required for the user to input including their name, the name of their repository, and a description of their project. If the user does not input anything into these, then it will keep prompting the user to input text until they finally do.
