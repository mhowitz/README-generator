  ## Description

  This project was created to gain more experience using server-side API's. I used OpenWeather to get coordinates when a user enters a location and then used those coordinates to get the weather data and append it to the screen. In this project, I used JavaScript, OpenWeather, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and LocalStorage. When the user searches a city, that city is added to a list of buttons below the search bar so the user may click on those buttons and revisit that city's weather data. This was done using local storage.
